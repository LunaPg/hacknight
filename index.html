    We're female developers in Montreal. We decided that Montreal needs
    another event for female developers to hang out, talk technology, and hack
    on cool projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bring yourself, your vexing technical problems, and your expertise!  If
    you feel like coding, bring a laptop. We provide food and internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're interested in giving a talk at a future meetup or have any other
    suggestions, <a href="mailto:todo-fake-email@example.com">email us</a>.
