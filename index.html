      We're female developers in Montreal. We decided that Montreal needs
      another event for female developers to hang out, talk technology, and hack
      on cool projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring yourself, your vexing technical problems, and your expertise!  If
      you feel like coding, bring a laptop. We provide food, internet and witty banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're interested in giving a talk at a future meetup or have any other
      suggestions, questions, or photos of cats you'd like to share, <a href="mailto:todo-fake-email@example.com">email us</a>.
